# Setapp tech task

[Demo](https://itunes-top-albums.herokuapp.com/) - Deployed on Heroku


### Description
-------
Tools and libraries:
- React for building UI.
- Redux with Redux Thunk for state management.
- React Router v4.
- Jest + Enzyme for testing.
- Lodash for utils functions like (_.get or _.isEqual).
- Installed node-sass and used SCSS.

General:
- Styles and design created from scratch - That's why I didn't use CSS Frameworks.
- Search works for Album title or Artist name.
- Added additional feature called 'likes'. User can like album in album details view. Likes are stored in localStorage and passed directly to the Redux state when app runs.
- Application looks good on small devices. I used flexbox and didn't used media queries, because it already looks nice on big, medium and small screens.
- Deployed application to Heroku (cloud platform).
- Covered main methods and utils functions by tests.
