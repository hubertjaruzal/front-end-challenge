Front End Challenge
====================

This is a coding challenge to assess your qualifications as a potential front-end developer. This is by no means a test. We just want to get a sense of how you write code and solve problems.

You can choose your own path that reflects your technical skills along the way. Spend as little or as much time as you would like to complete your chosen path. 

### The Challenge
-------
Imagine, one of our clients is branching into the music business and need a new a website. This website needs to display the top 100 songs based on the iTunes API.   

#### Base Requirements For All Levels
-------
- Show top 100 albums based on the json feed here:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topalbums/limit=100/json
- A clean modern look
- Clean, readable, maintainable codebase
- Source code on Github
- Cross browser support (or graceful degradation) in newest Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge (if you don't have either safari or edge that's fine)
- Responsive design and implementation
- A good user experience
